# Weather App

![Weather App](/assets/images/weather-app-header.png)

A basic weather app, built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript using two third party APIs: [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) for weather data, and [Open Street Map](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) for geolocation.

By using these two APIs, the user can look up their current location or search for any location in the world and receive real-time weather data.

## Objectives

The original objectives of the project were:

- Build an app leveraging a third-party weather API.
- Work in a team using the Driver-Navigator/pair programming approach.
- Practice planning before jumping into coding.
- Deliver an MVP within a tight timeframe.

## Technical Requirements

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- External API: Utilize a public API for real-time weather data.

## Refactoring

This project was originally intended as a simple one-day project but I enjoyed it so much I took the time to add much improved styling and features:

- Completely overhauled the styling, colors and UI.
- Added a full imageset (sourced online) of weather illustrations.
- Added the ability to update location with day and night mode based user's location.
- Added the ability to switch from Celcius to Fahrenheit.
